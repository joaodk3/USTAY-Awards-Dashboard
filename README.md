# USTAY Sales Dashboard

Welcome to the USTAY Sales Dashboard! This React Vite CSS application is designed to provide a comprehensive overview of the sales from partners' data for USTAY company. The dashboard calculates and displays total sales through intuitive cards, graphs, and statistical information in sales orders. Additionally, an admin can log in through an authentication process and edit the website database, which is stored in the Supabase Postgres database and is manipulated with Nodejs on the front-end, allowing for dynamic updates to the displayed information.
